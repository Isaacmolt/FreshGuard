# Privacy Policy — FreshGuard (鮮守衛)

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Overview

FreshGuard ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally
- **Item data**: Names, expiry dates, and storage dates of items you add. This data is stored **only on your device** and is **never transmitted** to any server.
- **Settings**: Your language, timezone, theme, and notification preferences are stored locally on your device.

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do **not** collect personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or location.
- We do **not** track your usage behavior or analytics.
- We do **not** share any data with third parties.

### In-App Purchases
- Purchase transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.

### Notifications
- We use local notifications (not push from a server) to remind you about expiring items. Notification data never leaves your device.

### Future Advertising
- A future version of the app may include advertisements. If implemented, the ad provider (e.g., Google AdMob) may collect anonymous device identifiers in accordance with their own privacy policy. We will update this policy before any such change.

## Data Security

All data is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms. We do not operate servers that store your data.

## Children's Privacy

FreshGuard does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and on our website.
